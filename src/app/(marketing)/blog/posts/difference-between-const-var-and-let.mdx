# What is the difference between const var and let in JavaScript?

Understanding variable declarations is crucial in JavaScript. Let's explore the three ways to declare variables: `const`, `var`, and `let`, and understand their key differences and use cases.

<br />

### What is const in JavaScript?

`const` is used to declare constants - variables whose values cannot be reassigned after initialization. This makes your code more predictable and helps prevent accidental changes.

<br />

<CodeSnippet code={`
const name = "John";
name = "Jane"; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable

// However, for objects and arrays:
const user = { name: "John" };
user.name = "Jane"; // This works - only reassignment is prevented
`} language="js" filename="js-1.js" />

<br />

`const` variables are block-scoped, meaning they are only accessible within the block they are declared in (like within if statements or loops).

<br />

### What is var in JavaScript?

`var` is the original way to declare variables in JavaScript. It has some unique behaviors that can sometimes lead to unexpected results.

<br />

<CodeSnippet code={`
var name = "John";
name = "Jane"; // This works fine

// Function scope example
function example() {
    var x = 1;
    if(true) {
        var x = 2; // Same variable!
        console.log(x); // 2
    }
    console.log(x); // 2
}

// Hoisting example
console.log(hoisted); // undefined
var hoisted = "I am hoisted";
`} language="js" filename="js-2.js" />

<br />

`var` is function-scoped rather than block-scoped, and it gets hoisted to the top of its scope. These behaviors can make code harder to understand and maintain, which is why modern JavaScript tends to avoid `var`.

<br />

### What is let in JavaScript?

`let` provides a more predictable way to declare variables that need to be reassigned. It combines the flexibility of `var` with better scoping rules.

<br />

<CodeSnippet code={`
let count = 1;
count = 2; // This works fine

// Block scope example
function example() {
    let x = 1;
    if(true) {
        let x = 2; // Different variable
        console.log(x); // 2
    }
    console.log(x); // 1
}

// No hoisting behavior
console.log(notHoisted); // ReferenceError
let notHoisted = "I am not hoisted";
`} language="js" filename="js-3.js" />

<br />

### When should you use const var or let?

Here are some guidelines for choosing between these declarations:

1. Use `const` by default
   - For values that won't be reassigned
   - For object and array references
   - Makes code intentions clearer

2. Use `let` when you need to reassign
   - For counters in loops
   - For values that change over time
   - When working with mutable state

3. Avoid `var` in modern code
   - Legacy code still uses it
   - Can lead to scope confusion
   - Lacks block scoping benefits

<br />

## Summary

- `const`: For values that won't be reassigned, block-scoped
- `var`: Legacy declaration, function-scoped, hoisted
- `let`: For reassignable values, block-scoped, no hoisting
