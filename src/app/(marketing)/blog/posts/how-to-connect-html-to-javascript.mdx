# Connecting HTML to JavaScript

JavaScript powers interactivity on 98.8% of all websites (as of 2024). 
If you're learning web development, one of the first skills you'll need is connecting HTML to JavaScript. 
This guide will walk you through the process step-by-step, from linking files to manipulating DOM elements and adding event listeners. 
By the end, you'll know how to create dynamic, interactive web pages with ease.

## Creating the HTML File

To connect HTML to JavaScript, you first need to create the HTML file.

<CodeSnippet content={`<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Connect HTML to JavaScript</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <!-- Button with an ID for JavaScript to target -->
    <button id="myButton">Click me</button>

    <!-- Link to external JavaScript file -->
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>`} />

## Creating the JavaScript File

Next, you need to create the JavaScript file.

<CodeSnippet content={`
// script.js
// Add an event listener to the button
document.getElementById('myButton').addEventListener('click', function() {
    alert('Button clicked!');
});
`} />

## Connecting the Files

In order for the JavaScript file to work, you need to include it in the HTML file via a script tag.

<CodeSnippet content={`<html>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
        <button id="myButton">Click me</button>
    </body>
</html>`} />

## Best Practices

When including JavaScript in your HTML file, it's important to follow some best practices.

- Use External JavaScript Files: Improves readability and maintainability.
- Place Script Tags at the End: Ensures the HTML loads before the script runs.
- Use defer or async Attributes: Optimizes script loading for better performance.
