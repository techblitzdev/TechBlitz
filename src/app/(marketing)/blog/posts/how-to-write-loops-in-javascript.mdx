# How to write loops in JavaScript

In programming, loops are used to repeat a block of code. They are a fundamental concept in JavaScript and many other programming languages to make your programs more efficient.

There are three types of loops in JavaScript:

- `for` loops
- `while` loops
- `do...while` loops

Let's take a look at each type of loop, how to use them and when to use them.

## For Loops

For loops are the most basic type of loop in JavaScript. They are used to repeat a block of code a specific number of times.

<br />

The syntax for a for loops is as follows:

<CodeSnippet code={`for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    console.log(i);

        // This will be console logged 10 times
}`} language="javascript" filename="javascript-1.js" />

<br />

Let's break down the syntax:

- `let i = 0`: This is the initialization of the loop. It sets the variable `i` to 0. This is the starting point of the loop.
- `i < 10`: This is the condition that the loop will continue to run as long as it is true.
- `i++`: This is the increment statement. It increments the variable `i` by 1 each time the loop runs. If we didn't have this, the loop would run forever.

<br />

## While Loops

While loops are used to repeat a block of code while a condition is true.

They differ from for loops in that they don't require an initialization statement, and will continue to run as long as the condition is true.

<br />

The syntax for a while loop is as follows:

<CodeSnippet code={`let i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
}`} language="javascript" filename="javascript-2.js" />

<br />

Let's break down the syntax:

- `let i = 0;`: This is the initialization of the loop. It sets the variable `i` to 0. This is the starting point of the loop.
- `while (i < 10) {`: This is the condition that the loop will continue to run as long as it is true.
- `i++;`: This is the increment statement. It increments the variable `i` by 1 each time the loop runs.

<br />

## Do...While Loops

Do...while loops are similar to while loops, but they will always run at least once. This is because the condition is checked after the loop has run.   

<br />

The syntax for a do...while loop is as follows:

<CodeSnippet code={`let i = 0;
do {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
} while (i < 10);`} language="javascript" filename="javascript-3.js" />

<br />

Let's break down the syntax:

- `do {`: This is the starting point of the loop.
- `console.log(i);`: This is the code that will be executed each time the loop runs.
- `i++;`: This is the increment statement. It increments the variable `i` by 1 each time the loop runs.
- `} while (i < 10);`: This is the condition that the loop will continue to run as long as it is true.

<br />

## Nested Loops

Nested loops are loops that contain another loop. This allows you to repeat a block of code multiple times.

<br />

The syntax for a nested loop is as follows:

<CodeSnippet code={`for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
        console.log(i, j);
    }
}`} language="javascript" filename="javascript-4.js" />

<br />

When writing nested loops, it is important to use different variables for the loops. If we used the same variable, the inner loop would overwrite the outer loop's variable.

<br />

Nested loops can also become quite complex, so you must ensure that the loops are written correctly.

<br />

## When to use each type of loop

- Use a `for` loop when you know exactly how many times you want to repeat the code.
- Use a `while` loop when you don't know how many times you want to repeat the code, but you know the condition.
- Use a `do...while` loop when you want to repeat the code at least once, but you don't know how many times you want to repeat the code.

## The most common type of loop

The most common type of loop is the `for` loop. It is used when you know exactly how many times you want to repeat the code.
