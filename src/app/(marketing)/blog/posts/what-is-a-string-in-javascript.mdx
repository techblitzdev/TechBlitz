# What is a String in JS?

A string represents a sequence of characters (letters, numbers, symbols, etc.). They are immutable, which means they cannot be changed after they are created. 
Strings are incredibly useful for storing and manipulating text data in an application.

## How to create a string

Creating a string in JS is very straightforward. You simply declare a variable (either `const`, `let`, or `var`, learn more about the difference [here](/javascript-fundamentals/difference-between-const-var-and-let)), give the string a name, and then assign the string to the variable.

In this tutorial, we will use `const` to declare the variable.

<br />

<CodeSnippet code={`
const method1 = 'Hello, world!';
const method2 = "Hello, world!";
const method3 = \`Hello, world!\`;
`} language="js" filename="js-1.js" />

<br />
So, what's the difference between the three methods?
Well, the first two methods are essentially the same. They both create a string using the same syntax. The only difference is that the first method uses single quotes and the second method uses double quotes.

<br />
The third method is a bit different. It uses backticks (\`\`) to create a string. Backticks allow you to embed variables directly within the string using template literals. For example:

<br />

<CodeSnippet code={`
const name = "John";
const greeting = \`Hello, \${name}!\`; // "Hello, John!"
`} language="js" filename="js-2.js" />

<br />

This is called string interpolation, learn more about it [here](/javascript-fundamentals/javascript-format-strings-with-variables).

## String Concatenation in JavaScript

String concatenation is the process of combining two or more strings into a single string. In JavaScript, you can use the `+` operator to concatenate strings.

<br />

<CodeSnippet code={`
const firstName = "John";
const lastName = "Doe";
const fullName = firstName + " " + lastName; // "John Doe"

// output: "John Doe"
`} language="js" filename="js-3.js" />

<br />

You can also use the `concat` method to concatenate strings, this method is more readable and flexible than the `+` operator.

<br />

<CodeSnippet code={`
const firstName = "John";
const lastName = "Doe";
const fullName = firstName.concat(" ", lastName); // "John Doe"

// output: "John Doe"
`} language="js" filename="js-4.js" />

<br />

## String manipulation in JavaScript

String manipulation is the process of changing the content of a string. In JavaScript, you can use various methods to manipulate strings.

<br />

### Get the length of a string

To get the length of a string, you can use the `length` property. This will return how many characters are present in a given string.

<br />

<CodeSnippet code={`
const message = "Hello, world!";
const length = message.length; // 13

// output: 13
`} language="js" filename="js-5.js" />

<br />

## Adding Apostrophes in Strings

Apostrophes can cause issues when writing strings in JS. 
For example, if you want to write 'I don't know' in a string, you can't use an apostrophe in the string because it will be interpreted as the end of the string.

<br />

<CodeSnippet code={`
    const message = 'I don't know'; // This will throw an error
`} language="js" filename="js-6.js" />

<br />

There are a few ways to solve this problem. Let's look at the most common ones.

### Use double quotes

<br />

<CodeSnippet code={`   
const message = "I don't know"; // This will work
`} language="js" filename="js-7.js" />

<br />

In the example above, we used double quotes to create the string. This way, we can use an apostrophe in the string without it being interpreted as the end of the string. 

### Use backticks

We can also use backticks to create the string. This way, we can use an apostrophe in the string without it being interpreted as the end of the string. 

<br />

<CodeSnippet code={`
const message = \`I don't know\`; // This will work
`} language="js" filename="js-8.js" />

<br />

In the example above, we used backticks to create the string. This way, we can use an apostrophe in the string without it being interpreted as the end of the string. 

### Using JavaScript to Turn Strings to Uppercase and Lowercase

If you need to transform a string to uppercase/lowercase not using css, you can use the `toUpperCase` and `toLowerCase` methods to turn strings to uppercase and lowercase respectively.

<br />

<CodeSnippet code={`
const message = "Hello, world!";
const uppercaseMessage = message.toUpperCase();
const lowercaseMessage = message.toLowerCase();

// output: "HELLO, WORLD!"
// output: "hello, world!"
`} language="js" filename="js-9.js" />

<br />

## Test if a string contains a substring

You can use the `includes` method to test if a string contains a substring. This method will return `true` if the substring is present in the string and `false` otherwise.

<br />

<CodeSnippet code={`
const message = "Hello, world!";
const containsHello = message.includes("Hello");

// output: true
`} language="js" filename="js-10.js" />
